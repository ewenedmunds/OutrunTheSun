# OutrunTheSun

This game was made for the Kindred Community Jam: https://itch.io/jam/kindred-community-jam, over the course of a week.
The aim of the game is to reach your crypt before the sun rises. 
To do this you must navigate the dark landscape and find upgrades which will help future runs. 

The game is hard and so several runs might be required.
Nevertheless, it is possible to complete the game on the very first run!

The theme of the jam was 'death is a new beginning', which has been interpreted in this game in two main ways:
1. Every death reverts your progress through the map, and thus each death brings a new beginning to a run where you are equipped with more knowledge and skills
2. Every death resets the timer for the sun to rise, and thus each death brings a new dawn; a literal new beginning to a day


As the game was made for a competition in only a week, the code and scene layout are not quite as nice as I would like, due to the limited time!
